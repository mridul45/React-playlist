# JS vs React

1. JS is imperative, we need to define steps to reach our desired state.
2. React is Declarative, we need to define the target UI state and then react figures out how to reach that state.


# Components

Components helps us write reusable, modular and better organised code.
React application is a tree of components with App Component as the root bringing everything together.
